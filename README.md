Bidirectional Communication Between Jetson Nano and Arduino
This guide demonstrates how to establish bidirectional communication between a Jetson Nano and an Arduino. The setup includes sending data from the Arduino to the Jetson Nano and vice versa, with experiments to test each scenario.

Components Needed
Jetson Nano
Arduino (any model)
USB cable for Arduino
Potentiometer
LEDs and resistors
Breadboard and jumper wires
Part 1: Sending Data from Arduino to Jetson Nano
Description
In this part, we send data from the Arduino to the Jetson Nano. The Arduino reads values from a potentiometer and transmits these values to the Jetson Nano, where they are printed on the screen.

Experiment 1
Connect the Arduino to your computer and upload the provided Arduino code.
Open a terminal on the Jetson Nano.
Run the provided Python script on the Jetson Nano.
Rotate the potentiometer connected to the Arduino and observe the changing values printed on the Jetson Nano screen.
Part 2: Sending Data from Jetson Nano to Arduino
Description
In this part, we send data from the Jetson Nano to the Arduino. The Jetson Nano sends commands to control three LEDs connected to the Arduino. Each command (1, 2, 3, 0) turns on a specific LED and turns off the others.

Experiment 2
Connect the LEDs to the Arduino pins as defined in the provided Arduino code.
Upload the Arduino code.
Open a terminal on the Jetson Nano and run the provided Python script.
Enter commands (1, 2, 3, 0) and observe the corresponding LEDs lighting up or turning off on the Arduino.
Part 3: Bidirectional Communication
Description
In this part, we establish bidirectional communication. The Arduino sends potentiometer values to the Jetson Nano, which processes these values and sends back commands to control an LED on the Arduino.

Experiment 3
Connect the potentiometer to the Arduino as defined in the provided Arduino code.
Connect an LED to the defined pin on the Arduino.
Upload the Arduino code.
Open a terminal on the Jetson Nano and run the provided Python script.
Rotate the potentiometer and observe the LED on the Arduino turning on and off based on the potentiometer's value.
Conclusion
This guide covered setting up bidirectional communication between a Jetson Nano and an Arduino. We verified data transmission in both directions through three experiments and combined the functionalities for continuous data exchange. This setup can be expanded and modified to suit specific project needs.
